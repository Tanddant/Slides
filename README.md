# Dan Toft's slides 🚀

Here you'll find slides from all the public speaking I do. 📢

<sub>I'll try to keep them up to date, but if you find something missing, please let me know. 🤫</sub> 



All slides (and any other assets that might be needed) are organized in folder like this:

```
Year-Month-Day - Event - Title
```

I hope you'll find them useful 🤞
